# SPIFFE/SPIRE Workload Identity — Reference Architecture

This repository is a reference architecture and adoption framework for [SPIFFE/SPIRE](https://spiffe.io/) workload identity. It is designed to help engineering and security teams adopt workload attestation without requiring deep prior knowledge of the problem space — you should not need to know the right questions to ask before reading this.

The repository has two parallel tracks:

- **Reference Architecture** — Platform-agnostic design patterns, decisions, and rationale. Read this if you are evaluating or designing a workload identity implementation.
- **Proof of Concept** — A runnable GCP + AWS SPIRE deployment orchestrated with Crossplane and Temporal, validating the reference architecture patterns end-to-end. Read this if you are implementing.

## Documentation Site

The documentation is served by a Bun + Hono TypeScript server:

```bash
bun install
make dev    # auto-reload on changes
make start  # production start
```

Run `make` for all available targets.

## What Problem Does This Solve?

Traditional service authentication relies on long-lived secrets: Kerberos keytabs, API keys, static TLS certificates, and service account tokens. These credentials are difficult to rotate, hard to scope, and routinely outlive their intended purpose.

SPIFFE/SPIRE replaces these mechanisms with **platform-based workload attestation**: instead of a service proving identity by presenting a secret it was given, it proves identity by demonstrating *where it is running* — on a specific cloud instance, in a specific Kubernetes namespace with a specific service account, running a specific binary. The platform infrastructure cryptographically vouches for this. The resulting short-lived credential (an SVID) is scoped to the workload, rotated automatically, and useless outside its intended context.

## Scope Boundaries

**In scope (this repository):** Connected infrastructure — GCP, Azure, AWS, and on-premises environments with network connectivity to the upstream SPIRE cluster.

**Out of scope:** Air-gapped and isolated network segments. These require independent trust domains, manual trust bundle provisioning, and different operational models. That design work is captured separately.
